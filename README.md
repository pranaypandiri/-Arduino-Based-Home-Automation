# Arduino-Based-Home-Automation
The smart home automation project aimed to create an intelligent, energy-efficient, and safe residential environment by integrating various sensors, controllers, and remote-control capabilities. The system utilized components such as MQ6 (gas sensor), DHT11(temperature and humidity sensor), ultrasonic sensor, water level sensor, soil moisture sensor, LDR sensor (light detection), actuators,and Bluetooth for seamless communication and automation. My role involved designing and implementing the project, ensuring effective integration of the sensors and actuators to automate tasks like lighting, water management, gas detection, and environmental monitoring. The outcomes included a highly efficient and user-friendly smart home system that improved energy utilization, enhanced safety through real-time alerts, and automated daily tasks, contributing to a more sustainable and convenient living environment.
